## HCI-Project I Outline 

- Group: Group-4
- Members: 高庆麾、阮毅凡



This Project is naturally splitted into three parts: basic work (Preparation), training deep learning model (Training) and integrating model to Android app (Integration). This outline will briefly introduce the work to be done in these three aspects: 

- Preparation (collective work)
  - Define Gestures 
    - determine the gestures to recognize (by group discussion)
  - Data Collection
    - record relevant motion data by all members (to ensure diversity)

- Training
  - Data Clear
    - get rid of vacillation
  - Model Training
    - fine-tune hyperparameters and effctively train the model
  - Model Optimizing
    - reduce the model size, in order to upload it to app
  - Model Exporting 
    - freeze and export the model 
- Integration
  - API Creating and Calling in Android Demo app
    - create APIs to interact with the uploaded model
  - Android Library Development
    - develop all this suit into a library 



After discussion, detailed division of all the work mentioned above will be tagged onto outline.
